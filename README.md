This project investigates the persuasive and awareness effects of online user reviews on the financial performance of firms in a range of industries. In contrast to research that views online reviews as mere reflections of company performance or outcomes, this study investigates how the valence and volume of online reviews can considerably impact the financial performance of firms. After employing a two-way fixed effect regression to account for company and time invariances, the findings revealed significant insights. Specifically, there is a negative correlation between the valence of online user reviews and the financial performance of the companies in this study. In contrast, although there is a positive correlation between the number of online reviews and financial performance, this effect is found to be long-lasting and to manifest over a long period of time indicating the importance of creating awareness and making a product or brand known. These findings highlight the complex relationship between online reviews and a company's financial performance.
