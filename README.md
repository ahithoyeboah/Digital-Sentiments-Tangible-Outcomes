# Digital-Sentiments-Tangible-Outcomes
## A study of online reviews and financial performance through senô€†Ÿment analysis.



#### Background
##### Introduction
This project investigates the persuasive and awareness effects of online user reviews on the financial performance of firms in a range of industries. In contrast to research that views online reviews as mere reflections of company performance or outcomes, this study investigates how the valence and volume of online reviews can considerably impact the financial performance of firms. After employing a two-way fixed effect regression to account for company and time invariances, the findings revealed significant insights. Specifically, there is a negative correlation between the valence of online user reviews and the financial performance of the companies in this study. In contrast, although there is a positive correlation between the number of online reviews and financial performance, this effect is found to be long-lasting and to manifest over a long period of time indicating the importance of creating awareness and making a product or brand known. These findings highlight the complex relationship between online reviews and a company's financial performance.



##### Objectives
The main objectives of this project included the following:
*Conduct sentiment analysis with Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning(VADER) and TextBlob on a comprehensive dataset of online reviews extracted from Trustpilot to assess the prevailing customer sentiments toward various firms.
*Analyse the relationship between online review sentiments and key financial performance metrics, such as revenue, gross profit, and net income.
*Analyse the relationship between the volume of online review sentiments and key financial performance metrics, such as revenue, gross profit, and net income.
*Examine the differential effects of positive and negative online reviews on firm financials to understand the asymmetric nature of customer feedback.

##### Methods
The NLTK VADER library provided a pre-trained sentiment analysis model specifically designed for social media text, which allowed me to determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) of each review. This analysis provided insights into the overall satisfaction or dissatisfaction of Apple employees.

Additionally, I employed the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis and extract additional features such as subjectivity, which measures the degree of personal opinion in a given review. This allowed for a more nuanced understanding of the sentiments expressed by employees.

Furthermore, in addition to sentiment analysis, I conducted topic modeling to identify common themes and topics discussed in the reviews. By applying techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), I was able to extract the main topics that emerged from the reviews. This analysis provided a deeper understanding of the key areas of interest or concern among Apple employees.


##### Conclusion
This sentiment analysis project using Python, NLTK VADER, TextBlob, and topic modeling techniques enabled a comprehensive evaluation of Apple's employee reviews on Glassdoor. By analyzing sentiment polarity, subjectivity, and identifying dominant topics, the project shed light on the overall sentiment and key areas of focus within the Apple employee community.
